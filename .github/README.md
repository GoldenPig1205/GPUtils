# GPUtils
"GoldenPig1205 Utils" for SCP: Secret Laboratory

There are Videos and Images folders in the **GPUtils** path of Configs.

Put your photo files in the Images folder.
Create another folder in the Videos folder and put the extracted photos by frame into it.

ex)
Images/test.png (size, time)
`/textpaint test.png_10_10`

Videos/A pig on a bed
`/playvideo A pig on a bed`

this was just created, so it needs some fine-tuning
I recommend you create a new plugin or open the Pull Request
